Built on top of the listings package, the matlab-prettifier package allows
you to effortlessly prettyprint Matlab source code in documents typeset with
LaTeX & friends. Three predefined styles, one of which closely mimicks that
of the Matlab editor, are available and can be invoked by listings macros
and environments in conjunction with (most) options provided by the listings
package. The appearance of your Matlab listings can be further tweaked via a
key-value interface extending that of listings'. Partial support for Octave
syntax is provided.
